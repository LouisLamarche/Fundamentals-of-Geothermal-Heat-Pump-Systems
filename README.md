These files are the solutions of the Examples given in the book

THey are all written in python 3.11.4 using the Anaconda distribution. 

The libraries are in the directory lib. This directory must be in the pythopath.

For example, if you put the files in the directory: 

C:\documents\GSHP

then the directory 

C:\documents\GSHP\lib must be in the python path. 


Some other modules are necessary: 

pip install Coolprop

pip install xlrd

pip install xlwt
