    Message               : The controller was stuck during           0 time steps, i.e.     0.000000000000000     % of the time (Note that you have set NStick < 1. In that case the controller is stuck when further oscillations would trigger the 'maximum number of iterations' warning. Use a large number if you do not want this behavior).
